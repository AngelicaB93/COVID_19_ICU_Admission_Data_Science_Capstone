## Abstract
This project aimed to develop machine learning models that predict which COVID-19 patients are most likely to need to be admitted to the ICU. Using the data gathered from the patients, I explored which components are more critical when building an effective and efficient machine-learning model for predictive analysis. This conclusion was discussed using techniques such as exploratory da data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model development, and hyperparameter tuning. The results from the machine learning model will show that I have obtained an excellent accuracy score and feel confident about the overall predictability. The implementation of this model will enhance the clinical decision-making process.

## Business Problem
 Determining which patients are required to be admitted into the ICU in a timely matter is what many hospitals are challenged with today. It is critical to allocate the space available appropriately. Building a model that can predict the patient's need for ICU admission in a timely manner can assist with improving the rates. This paper will explore how I build a machine-learning algorithm that can support and predict ICU admissions using patient-required data obtained during the patient's initial admission into the hospital.

## Data
The dataset used in this research was the Sírio-Libanês data for AI and Analytics by Data Intelligence Team from Kaggle website [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/S%C3%ADrio-Libanes/covid19]. This dataset contains COVID-19 clinical data to assess the initiate diagnosis. The feature in the dataset includes demographic information, patient previously grouped diseases, blood results, vital signs, and blood gases. Before any changes to the data, there is a total of 385 patients.

## Method
The dataset underwent all the preprocessing and EDA steps. It was then tested using the following machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Hyperparameters were also used to increase the chosen model's overall accuracy rate.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, this research was successful in building a machine-learning model that can predict ICU admission using clinical data with a reasonable accuracy rate. The random forest model yields the highest overall accuracy rate after the proper hyperparameters were included and tuned accordingly. In the research paper titled “COVID_19_ICU_Admission_Research_Paper” you will be able see all the detailed findings.
